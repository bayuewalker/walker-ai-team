## CrusaderBot Work Checklist

Last Updated: 2026-05-01 08:39 Asia/Jakarta

## Current Truth

CrusaderBot Priority 9 is COMPLETE. Public paper-beta path ACCEPTED by WARP🔹CMD on 2026-05-01.

- Priorities 1-7 complete.
- Priority 8 build complete; activation gated.
- Priority 9 Lanes 1+2, 3, 4, and 5 complete.
- Priority 9 Lane 5 ACCEPTED as public paper-beta via PR #840 (smoke evidence) SHA 91929fa34534. Smoke matrix: 6/8 PASS; Telegram surfaces BLOCKED by env constraint (routing verified, not code defect).

Activation guards (paper-beta boundary preserved):
- `EXECUTION_PATH_VALIDATED` NOT SET
- `CAPITAL_MODE_CONFIRMED` NOT SET
- `ENABLE_LIVE_TRADING` NOT SET

No live-trading or production-capital readiness claim is authorized. Live/capital activation remains a separate gated decision pending explicit Mr. Walker + WARP🔹CMD ruling.
